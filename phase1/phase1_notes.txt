1. What status line did you get and what does it mean?
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK ->> means request was successful and sserver returned requested page 

2. What is the Server header value? Is it specific (nginx/1.22) or generic? 
Server: Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu) --> tells us exactly what server software, version and os its running 

1. What is the <title> of the page (if present)?
Go ahead and ScanMe!

2. Do you see any ```<form>``` elements? What are their action attributes (copy them)?
  <form class="nst-search" id="nst-head-search" action="/search/">

Did requests and curl report the same status and server header?
 yes, responds with the same headers as the client

If different, what header or other factor might explain it (redirects, default headers, user agent)?
  If different, it could be because:
- User-Agent differences bc server treats curl vs python differently
- requests follows redirects automatically, curl -I doesn't
- Some servers block scanning tools but allow browsers


Did the response change (status, server header, content-length) when the User-Agent was MyTestAgent/1.0?
  No, the response didnt change, Both requests returned the same status, headers, and content from httpbin.org.

If it had changed, what could that mean about the server’s defenses?
  it could mean the server has:
- WAF (Web Application Firewall) blocking suspicious User-Agents
- Security rules that block scanning tools like sqlmap/nikto
- Different content for bots vs real browsers
- Rate limiting or blocking for unknown user agents

What three pieces of information from the steps above would be most useful in a reconnaissance report, and why?
1. Server header (Apache/2.4.7 Ubuntu) - reveals specific software versions that may have known vulnerabilities
2. HTTP status codes (200, 301, 404) - maps site structure and finds hidden pages or redirects
3. Form elements with methods/actions - identifies user input points like login forms that can be tested for security flaws


One quick defensive suggestion an admin could use to reduce information leakage from headers.
Configure the web server to remove or genericize the Server header (e.g., change "Apache/2.4.7 Ubuntu" to just "Web Server")
 to prevent attackers from identifying specific software versions with known vulnerabilities.
